# SMART on FHIR flow in Jupyter
This repo contains two demos:
    - `server_extension`: a Jupyter server extension that acts as public client for a SMART server with asymmetric authentication.
    - `hub_service`: a JupyterHub service that acts as confidential client for a SMART server and authenticates with an asymmetric flow.

Check the READMEs in the respective folders for more information. Work in progress.
