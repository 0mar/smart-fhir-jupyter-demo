# SMART on FHIR flow in Jupyter

This repo contains two demos:

- `server_extension`: a Jupyter server extension that acts as public client for a SMART server.
- `hub_service`: a JupyterHub service that acts as confidential client for a SMART server and performs asymmetric authentication.

Check the READMEs in the respective folders for more information. Work in progress.
